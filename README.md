akutils
=========================

Andy's random collection of javascript utility functions.


### Installation

To install the stable version:

```
npm install --save f.lux-react
```

This assumes you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager.


## Purpose

To make it easier for me to share and consume our own JavaScript. P

**Note:** If you are consuming the code here, be prepared for a bad time. APIs may appear or disappear and I may not follow semver strictly, though I will do my best to. This library is being published with my use cases in mind and is not necessarily meant to be consumed by the broader public. In order for me to move fast and ship projects, I've made the decision to not support everybody. I probably won't take your feature requests unless they align with our needs. There will be overlap in functionality here and in other open source projects.
